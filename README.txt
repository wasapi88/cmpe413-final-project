1) Edit the vivado_sim.tcl file in the vhdl folder
2) run this command: /umbc/software/scripts/launch_xilinx_vivado.sh -mode batch -source vivado_sim.tcl

Note: We have been running the testbench and all files directly in the vhdl folder because we could not get the simulation to run outside of that folder
